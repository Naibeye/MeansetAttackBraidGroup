# Cryptanalysis of Post-Quantum Signature Scheme based on the root extraction problem over braid group

We implemented on SageMath. It is a free open- source mathematics software system licensed under the
General Public License. We performed several sets of tests, all of which were run on an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-
1165G7 @ 2.80GHz computer with 16 GB of RAM, running Ubuntu 22.04. The secret r is obtained with a sample of
100 signatures in 85 seconds on average.
